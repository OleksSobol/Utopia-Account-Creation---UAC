<p>Hello {customer_name},</p>
    <p>Thank you for your recent request for Internet Service with Global Net via Yellowstone Fiber.&nbsp; We have received notification of your request through the Yellowstone Fiber portal. Global Net will monitor the construction progress in partnership with them.&nbsp; If you have any questions regarding the construction they can be reached at 406-312-5777.</p>
    <p>In preparation for what is to come here are a few things to consider, plan for, and discuss with the technician when they arrive:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Where should the Fiber ONT (modem) be installed?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Somewhere near a power outlet</li>
                <li>Somewhere accessible for troubleshooting purposes</li>
                <li>At your Smart Panel if you have one (see below for more information)</li>
            </ul>
        <p>Yellowstone Fiber will install the ONT and run a single Ethernet cable to your preferred, but reasonable, location for a router.&nbsp;<br>A link to the Top 10 Router Recommendations by Yellowstone Fiber can be found <a href="https://www.yellowstonefiber.com/top-10-router-recommendations/">HERE</a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Where should your router be located?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Centrally located in an open area of your home/office to ensure the best WiFi coverage</li><li>Somewhere easily accessible for troubleshooting</li>
                <li>As high up as possible to avoid obstruction by other items or devices</li>
                <li>At your Smart Panel if you have one (see below for more information)
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Where should you&nbsp;<strong><u>NOT</u></strong>&nbsp;place your router?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In a closet</li>
                <li>In a drawer</li>
                <li>On the floor</li>
                <li>In a crawlspace</li>
                <li>In a pantry</li>
                <li>Under a sink</li>
                <li>In an attic</li>
                <li>On a bookshelf covered with books</li>

            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>If you have a Smart Panel in your home/office and would like to utilize your existing home wiring or WiFi access points, it will be best to have your router located at the Smart Panel. Please refer to your Smart Home specialist or IT consultant with any questions as Global Net does not support, nor is responsible for, any internal networking configurations.</p>
    <p>Global Net and Yellowstone Fiber do not service or support the LAN side of your internet service. Customer-owned devices like your router, phones, computers, gaming consoles, IOT, and TVâ€™s are not supported by either company. These will be the responsibility of the customer to troubleshoot and maintain.</p>
    <p>After the installation of the Yellowstone Fiber ONT is complete <strong>BILLING WILL START</strong>.  If&nbsp;your router is available at the install, the installer will&nbsp;connect it&nbsp;to the ONT and&nbsp;will&nbsp;confirm you have internet access.</p>
    <br>
